# About

Hey there, welcome to the about page, where the awkwardness runs rife. 

I'm Marty, I'm an engineer of many trades, believing in a philisophy of the more trades one knows, the more trades one can fuse into some absurd solution. 

I mostly spend my days on DNS, but I also have a love for infrastructure & networking. You'll probably find me tinkering away on a Kubernetes stack, building networks or muttering *it's always DNS*
